**Features:**
- **Go** for the core application logic.
- **OpenAPI-first development** with to generate server stubs and models from an `openapi.yaml` spec. `oapi-codegen`
- **Type-safe database interaction** with `sqlc` to generate Go code from raw SQL queries.
- **Clear project structure** separating API definitions, business logic, database code, and configuration.
